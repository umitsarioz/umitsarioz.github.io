# Research & Post Ideas

- software: 
  - turing complete / turing machines
  - solid 
  - kiss
  - oop
  - orm
  - gui 
  - api 
  - clean code
  - http, ftp 
  - osi 
  - sequence diagram, uml diagram 
  - python zen
  - unittests
  - early/unnecessary optimization/abstraction
  - peter's principle * book
  - separation of concerns
  - curse of dimensionality 
  - getting to yes * book
  - correlation does not imply  causalition --> spurious correlations website
  - the mythical man-month * book
  - if i had more time, i would have written a shorter letter - mark twain :)
  
- machine learning:
  - nlp > llm 
  - time series problems > arima, sarima, deep learning 
  - optimization problems > traffic/stock
  - anomaly detection problems > 
  - graph problems > graph sage, graph attention
  - clustering problems > k-means, agglomerative, dbscan, fuzzy, gaussian mix, 
  - dimensionality reduction techniques > rfm, svd, pca, kernel pca, tsne
  - evaluation metrics > clustering, classification, llm, regression 
  - bias-variance tradeoff : learning curves, validation curves  
  - cross validation & gridsearch 
  - distributions > statistics 
  - matrix, matrix multiplication, vector etc. 
  - embedding, token, quantization etc. 
  - deep learning problems with pytorch > image recognition, binary classification, multi-class classification, regression etc. 
- bigdata & devops:
  - apache frameworks > cassandra, hdfs, spark, sqoop, kafka, flink, airflow, elasticsearch, kibana, logstash
  - grafana, mongodb, postgresql, vectordb, docker 
- tasks:
  - task definition, research, apply, write a documentation about process 
  - quicky write/improvement, then write details
  - set initial time-box for tasks 
  - always be success(!) 

# interview questions to company:
- test
- lead/team management
- meetings and frequency
- feedback/company culture 
- working hours
- learning curve/opportunities
