## Introduction

JupyterLab is your go-to environment for interactive data analysis, blending notebooks, text editors, and terminals into one seamless workspace. Itâ€™s like having a digital laboratory where you can experiment, visualize, and document all in real-time. Firstly, this guide will walk you through a hard setup, then we will move on easy setup to get you started swiftly. Using Docker Compose, you can quickly set up JupyterLab on Ubuntu without the usual setup headaches. 

## JupyterLab: The Ultimate Workspace for Data Science
### A Versatile Workspace for Every Language

Imagine JupyterLab as your go-to lab for data science and researchâ€”a place where you can code, visualize data, and jot down notes all in one spot. It supports multiple programming languages like Python, R, and Julia, making it incredibly flexible for different tasks. But, juggling between these languages can get tricky, especially since some have better support than others.

### An Integrated Environment for Smooth Workflows

One of the best things about JupyterLab is how it brings everything together. You can write code, see your data visualizations, and take notes all in the same workspace. This integration helps you work more efficiently, but if your project gets big, the interface can start to feel a bit crowded, and you might miss out on some of the advanced features you get with traditional IDEs.

### Customizable with Extensions

JupyterLabâ€™s extensibility is a real game-changer. You can add various plugins to tailor the environment to your needs, whether itâ€™s for version control, enhancing visualizations, or other functionalities. However, not all plugins are perfectly maintained, and some might not work with newer versions of JupyterLab, so you might need to tweak things yourself.

### Interactive Visualizations Made Easy

One of the coolest features of JupyterLab is its ability to create interactive visualizations. You can use libraries like Plotly or Bokeh to make your data come alive right in the notebook. Just keep in mind that if youâ€™re working with very large datasets or complex visualizations, things might slow down a bit, which can affect your workflow.

### Scalability and Performance

JupyterLab is also great for scaling up. Whether youâ€™re using Docker or running it in the cloud, it helps ensure that your setup remains consistent across different environments. However, while it scales well, handling massive datasets might cause performance issues, and setting up the necessary infrastructure can require some extra work.

>Overall, JupyterLab is a fantastic tool that simplifies data science and research, making complex tasks feel more manageable and engaging. After examine pros cons of jupyter lab **letâ€™s continue with installation approaches..**

- Letâ€™s do better this installation.
- Step 8 â€” Letâ€™s control our configurations on a file, so we can manage Jupyter Lab easier
    - Step 8.1 â€” Generate config file `jupyter-lab --generate-config`
    - Step 8.2 â€”  Generated password is written a `jupyter_server_config.json`  file. Hashed password will be use next step.
    - Step 8.3 â€” Open generated  `jupyter_lab_config.py` file and update these lines according to your needs.
        
        ```python
        c.ServerApp.ip = 'your-server-ip' # default localhost
        c.ServerApp.open_browser = False # default false
        c.ServerApp.password = 'hashed_password' # generated hashed password
        c.ServerApp.port = 8888 # default port is 8888
        ```

_Figure 5_ 

- Step 9 â€” Create a service for Jupyter Lab,
    - Step 9.1 â€” Create a services file with `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/jupyter-lab.service`
    - Step 9.2 â€” Configure this file according the your username and jupyter-lab environment path etc. You can learn jupyter lab path with `find ~ -name jupyter-lab` , your user name `id -un` ,your group name `id -gn`
    
    ```bash
    [Unit]
    Description = JupyterLab Service
    
    [Service]
    User = umits
    Group = umits
    Type = simple
    WorkingDirectory = /home/umits/
    ExecStart = /home/umits/jupyter-env/bin/jupyter-lab --config=/home/umits/.jupyter/jupyter_lab_config.py
    Restart = always
    RestartSec = 10
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy = multi-user.target
    ```

Voila! Another milestone is completed, I think this installation is enough for local development/projects. If you want to work remotely with your team/organization, you should add SSL certifi files and do remote port forwarding with nginx etc. There are many resources on the web ðŸ™‚ I might be update this post like included with them in the future. 

## Method 2: Dockerized JupyterLab Setup

If you want a simpler setup that avoids managing dependencies and conflicts, you can containerize JupyterLab using Docker. Docker allows you to run JupyterLab in an isolated environment, making it easier to install, manage, and share.

- Step 1 â€” Check updates `sudo apt update`
- Step 2 â€” Install docker `sudo apt install docker.io`
- Step 3 â€” Install docker-compose `sudo apt install docker-compose`
- Step 4 â€” Create `docker-compose.yml` file
- Step 5 â€” Run `docker-compose up -d` and you can reach your JupyterLab [localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889)

_Figure 8_ 

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  jupyterlab:
    image: jupyter/base-notebook:latest
    container_name: jupyterlab
    ports:
      - "8889:8888"
    volumes:
      - ./notebooks:/home/jovyan/work
    environment:
      - JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes
      - GRANT_SUDO=yes
      - JUPYTER_TOKEN=cokgizlitoken  # Set the token here
    command: start.sh jupyter lab # --LabApp.token='' # log without token

```

## JupyterLab Installation: Manual vs. Dockerized

### Manual Installation: Full Control and Flexibility

Manual installation of JupyterLab offers full control over your environment. You can customize every aspect of the setup, ensuring that it fits your specific needs. With direct access to system resources, you can optimize performance and integrate seamlessly with existing applications. Additionally, thereâ€™s no additional overhead from container layers, which can make it more efficient in certain scenarios.

However, managing dependencies manually can be complex, leading to potential conflicts between packages. This setup also poses a higher risk of version clashes and makes it harder to isolate different environments, which can complicate the management of multiple projects.

### Dockerized Setup: Convenience and Consistency

A Dockerized setup provides an isolated environment that prevents dependency conflicts, making it easier to manage different projects without worrying about package clashes. Sharing and deploying JupyterLab across various machines becomes straightforward, and managing versions and updates is simplified with Docker. Furthermore, Dockerâ€™s ability to scale with multiple containers can handle increased workloads efficiently.

On the flip side, containerization introduces a slight performance overhead compared to a native installation. Additionally, youâ€™ll need to have some knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose to set things up and maintain the environment. Also, direct access to system resources, like hardware acceleration, is limited within containers, which might impact performance for specific tasks.

>Choosing between manual installation and a Dockerized setup depends on your needs for control versus convenience, performance versus isolation, and the complexity you're willing to manage.
